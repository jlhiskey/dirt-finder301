    <p class="aboutUsP">Knows that you don't attempt to run up the stairs at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you order your steak "wit". Daniel was drawn to design from a young age when he started writing all over his older brothers' baseball cards and (what would be now) priceless comic books.</p>

  <h2>Jason Hiskey</h2>
  
  <div>
    <p class="aboutUsP">Jason was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. When he was 2 years old he moved to Washington where he spent the majority of his childhood in Monroe. While living in Monroe, he learned how to crash dirt bikes and jump off of tall objects into the water. He currently lives in the quickly growing town of Bothell. Before embarking on his coding journey, Jason was a staff geologist who worked on hundreds of construction sites in Seattle and Los Angeles. Jason likes to spend his free time working in his vegetable garden and spending way too much money buying new games on Steam. Jason enjoys most foods that exist but especially enjoys quesadillas. Jason plans on becoming a solid full stack Java Script Developer who will be able to save up enough money to one day finance and manage a food truck company called “The Quesadilla Factory”, which will cater toward fellow aficionados of quesadillas.
